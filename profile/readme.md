## ‚úâÔ∏è Contact Us
Looking to bring your Meower bot or library to our organisation? Contact [@showierdata9978](https://github.com/showierdata9978)!


## üìñ General Rules

1. Absolutely anything and everything in this organisation must be a Meower Bot or Bot library, unless you have permission from [@showierdata9978](https://github.com/showierdata9978)
2. All bots and bot libraries must be updated to follow new Meower Policies within 2 weeks 

## ü§ñ Bot Rules

1. Bots should not post in home. Exceptions for this are invites to a bot group chat or if you have permission from the Meower Council.
2. Bots should always follow the @ mention rule, meaning replacing prefixes and words with @{bot username}.

## üìö Bot Library Rules

1. All bot libraries must use @(bot username) as the prefix, but may allow changing the prefix for webhooks etc.
2. All bot libraries must support all official bridges, Discord (@Discord), Revower (@Revower) and Revower Unstable (@revolt).
3. All bot libraries should expose websocket objects to all users publically.

 
These rules will be enforced by @showierdata9978, and the Council of Meowers.
