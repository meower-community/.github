## General rules for this org


1. Anything in this org HAS TO BE A MEOWERBOT. OR MEOWERBOT LIB. Otherwise it will be deleted, unless you have explicit permision from @showierdata9978
2. All rules have 48h to be fixed and published

## Rules For bots in this ORG

1. Nothing in home, except a join command for its GC, and a reminder for ppl.
   This is bypassed if your bot has an approval to be in home by a person on the Council  

3. Bots should be compliant with the @ mentions rule. (@{username} {command} {args})

## Rules for bot libs

1. Must allow bot to be complient with the @ mentions rule. But allow the user to change the prefix (in the case of Webhooks @HookMod)
2. Must support all offical bridges (Discord, Revower, revolt (Revower Unstable))
3. Should expose Websocket object to all users PUBLICLY.

 
These rules will be inforced by @showierdata9978, and the Council of Meowers.
