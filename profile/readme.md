## üìñ General Rules

1. Absolutely anything and everything in this organisation must be related to Meower.
2. All bots and bot libraries must be updated to follow all Meower policies.

## ü§ñ Bot Policies

1. Bots should not post in home. There are 3 exceptions to this rule: invites to a bot group chat, if you have permission from the Meower Council, and commands that send less then 4 lines. 

2. Bots should always follow the @ mention rule, meaning replacing prefixes and words with @{bot username}.

## üìö Bot Library Rules

1. All bot libraries must use @(bot username) as the prefix, but may allow changing the prefix for webhooks etc.
2. All bot libraries must support all official bridges, Discord (@Discord), Revower (@Revower) and Revower Unstable (@revolt).
3. All bot libraries should expose websocket objects to all users publically.

These rules will be enforced by @showierdata9978, and the Council of Meowers.
